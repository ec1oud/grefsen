eglfs: touch doesn't work
raise/lower
way to get in/out of fullscreen mode
window decoration theme rather than server-side decorations
    because access to the QWindow is easier than dealing with limitations of Wayland protocol for window management
alt-tab
virtual desktops
window flinging onto other display
better hover handling
other 3-finger window gestures?
ctrl-alt-f key to get back to other consoles (chvt)
map caps lock to control (QTBUG-53183)
touch window drag/resize
long-press menu
dbus menubar & tray
xwayland: root window transparent, or under the grefsen desktop background? or rootless?
probably hard: decorate X windows (like Weston does)
device hotplugging?

to fix
------
connman configuration - can't always turn technologies on and off
the crash when killing applications via the titlebar close button
click outside popups to close
can't run grefsen inside grefsen (or is it impossible?)

done
----
basic sidebar with a basic launcher for konsole
some custom window decorations
launcher menu based on desktop files
launchers for more apps: qtcreator and a browser at least
-c for config
clock and calendar
xdg_shell protocol (weston and gtk apps don't run without it)
3-finger pinch to resize and move windows
alt-drag, meta-drag
